# Task 1
What forms of tests do you know from computer science?
Work in pairs and explain at least three examples that you know from practice.
How are the tests performed?

# Task 2
Give an example of a SW error and a SW deficiency.
Give an example of a high damage in the event of a SW error.

# Task 3
Software is usually divided into a number of subsystems, which in turn consist of a large number of elementary
components. We saw in the V model that there are different test levels. In this year, we want to
context now look at an example of the lowest level.
Example test in the price calculation class
In the car sales software, prices are provided with discounts.
We have the following elements and rules:
There is a base price, minus the dealer discount.
In addition, there is a special model surcharge (specialprice) and the price for additional equipment (extraprice).
If three or more extras are selected, then a discount of 10% will be applied to them
Kits. If there are five or more additional equipment, then the discount is 15%.
The dealer discount refers to the base price. The accessory discount applies only to the price of the accessories.
A code would thus look like this:

`

        double calculatePrice(double baseprice, double specialprice, double extraprice, int extras, double discount) {
            double addon_discount;
            double result;
            
            if (extras >= 3) 
                addon_discount = 10;
            else if (extras >= 5)
                addon_discount = 15;
            else 
                addon_discount = 0;
            
            if (discount > addon_discount)
                addon_discount = discount;
            
            result = baseprice/100.0 * (100-discount) + specialprice
                    + extraprice/100.0 * (100-addon_discount);
            
            return result;
	    }

`

Implement this code in your developer environment. Now create a corresponding test driver to test this price calculation. A test driver is a program that executes the respective interface calls (method call) and then receives the result back. Sketchily, it would look like this:

`
    
    boolean test_calculate_price(){

        double price;
        boolean test_ok = true;
    
        < your code>

    }
`

Attention: We do not write unit tests here. We will apply unit tests later in the module.
Put your tests in the repository and show your solution to the teacher.
Task 3 - Bonus

The program piece is faulty ;) Find the error in the code. What would have to be corrected?
